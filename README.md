Bird the word
=============

python script with command line interface. Script input is a 
text file and the output is statistics of word occurrences. 
As a result, the program must print out all unique words from 
the text with the number of their occurrences. Words in output must 
be sorted by number of their occurrences in descending order, 
words with the equal number of occurrences must be sorted in 
alphabetic order. Each word and number of its occurrences must be 
printed on a new line in format: <word>: <frequency>.

Example run:
python birdistheword.py data.txt
